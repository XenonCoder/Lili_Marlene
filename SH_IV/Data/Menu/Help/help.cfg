[Chapter5.Phrase2]
Phrase=<b>Non-Repairable Damage</b> affects the general integrity of the submarine hull. This type of damage is not repairable while in patrol. Beware - as your hull integrity is affected, your U-boat safe depth will decrease. Diving too deep will no longer be an option if your boat integrity is seriously affected. 

[Chapter5.Phrase3]
Phrase=<b>Repairable Damage</b> is specific to compartments, locations, and systems aboard the U-boat. Your crew can repair these items if they are not destroyed. Any destroyed system is lost until you return to base, where the system will automatically be replaced. Any dead crew member must be replaced when you return to base.

[Chapter5.Phrase4]
Phrase=The crewmen will always repair the equipments in their compartment. For more serious damages you should assemble a repair team (in the <b>Damage control team</b>). This team aids in the repair of the equipment/weapon that is listed first in the <b>Repair team priority</b> box. To change the order of equipments/weapons in the box you can:|  - select the item in the box and use the 2 buttons on the left to move it up or down|  - grab the damaged equipment from the sub and drop in the box. It will be moved to the top of the list and repairs will begin immediately.| Note that you have to activate <b>damage control team</b> (from the button in the HUD) for it to help with the repairs.

Transferring torpedoes from external storage to the internal reserves takes <b>time</b>, so make sure you do it only in safe locations and keep a good watch.

[Chapter6.Phrase3]

Title=<b>UZO/TBT</b>
PageID=0x28

[Chapter11.Phrase1]
Phrase=Contrary to popular belief, the most common type of U-boat attack took place on the surface, during the night. The choice aiming device was the <b>Uboot Zieloptik</b>, or <b>UZO</b>, which was placed on a rotating post on the bridge. For US Fleet boats, the equivalent optic is the Target Bearing Transmitter, or TBT.

[Chapter11.Phrase2]
Phrase=You can access the UZO or TBT by pressing the U key on the keyboard to be transported directly to its view.

[Chapter11.Phrase3]
Phrase=<b>Note: The UZO station, like the bridge, is only accessible while surfaced.</b>

[Chapter11.Phrase4]

Title=<b>TDC</b>
PageID=0x3b
Priority=Yes

[Chapter14.Phrase1]
Phrase=The Vorhaltrechner, or <b>Torpedo Data Computer (TDC)</b>, is the brain of the submarine's attack system. Using data provided by the player and the currently used optic (periscope or UZO), it computes the gyro-angle - the angle at which the torpedo will need to turn in order to enter a collision course with the target.

[Chapter14.Phrase2]
Phrase=<b>Sending Data to the TDC:</b>Once you have a complete set of data for the target, they need to be inserted in the TDC. On lower levels of difficulty, this is automatically done with the data collection, when the crosshairs pass over a target. 

[Chapter14.Phrase3]
Phrase=You can use the interface to view critical targeting data as received from the targeting systems, to view the trajectory of the torpedo(es) but also to change the torpedo running speed and depth or to set up a salvo.

[Chapter14.Phrase4]
Phrase=Specific to German submarines, you can use the TDC interface to set up shots for the late war Pattern Running Torpedoes - FaT and LuT.
